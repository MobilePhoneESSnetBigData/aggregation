\description{
This is a utility function with the purpose to build the files
 with joint posterior location probabilities for each device using the
 \code{destim} package an a series of additional data. This function was used
 to build the example data set included in this package The raw data were
 produced using the simulation software. The joint posterior location
 probabilities file names starts with \code{postLocJointProbDevice_} followed for
 the \code{deviceID} and the extension \code{.dt.csv}.
