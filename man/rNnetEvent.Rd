  distribution.}
\usage{
rNnetEvent(
  n,
  gridFileName,
  dupFileName,
  regsFileName,
  postLocPath,
  prefix,
  times,
  seed = 123
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{The number of random values to be generated.}

\item{gridFileName}{The name of the .csv file with the grid parameters.}

\item{dupFileName}{The name of the .csv file with the duplicity probability
for each device. This is an output of the \code{deduplication} package.}

\item{regsFileName}{The name of the .csv file defining the regions. It has
two columns: \code{ tile, region}. The first column contains the IDs of
each tile in the grid while the second contains the number of a region.
This file is defined by the user and it can be created with any text
editor.}

\item{postLocPath}{The path where the files with the posterior location
probabilities for each device can be found. A file with the location
probabilities should have the name \code{prefix_ID.csv} where \code{ID} is
replaced with the device ID and \code{prefix} is given as a parameter to
this function.}

\item{prefix}{A prefix that is used to compose the file name with posterior
location probabilities.}

\item{times}{A vector with the time instants when the events were
registered.}

\item{seed}{The value of the random seed to be used by the random number generator.}
}
\value{
A data.table object with the following columns: \code{time, region,
  N, iter}. The last column contains the index of the random value (given in
  column \code{N}) generated for each time instant and region.
}
\description{
Generates random values according to a Poisson multinomial
  probability distribution. A point estimation derived from this distribution
  (mean, mode) represents an estimation of the number of individuals detected
  by the network in a region. Regions are composed as a number of adjacent
  tiles. This is the only one function of this package available to users to
  compute an estimation of the number of detected individuals. For a
  theoretical background an interested reader can find more details
  in the methodological framework available here:
